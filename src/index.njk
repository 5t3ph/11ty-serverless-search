title: 11ty Serverless Search

<p>An example of using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/serverless/">11ty Serverless</a> to create site search using both local and external data.</p>

<p>External results from <a href="https://dev.to/5t3ph">Stephanie Eckles dev.to profile</a> are fetched as data, and local page data is globbed into an array as local data. 11ty Serverless doesn't currently support regular template collections, but it does have access to collections created from data. We combine the two data sources (external and local) into a new collection, then pass it through an 11ty filter to search the content and return an array to display as search results.</p>
