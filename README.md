# 11ty Serverless Search

An example of using [11ty Serverless](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/serverless/) to create site search. External results from [Stephanie Eckles dev.to profile](https://dev.to/5t3ph) are fetched as data, and then passed through an 11ty filter to search the content and return search results.

**To use, select "Use this template"**

> TODO: Add example of using local page data

## Development Scripts

**`npm start`**

> Run 11ty with hot reload at localhost:8080, including reload based on Sass changes

**`npm run build`**

> Production build includes minified, autoprefixed CSS

Use this as the "Publish command" if needed by hosting such as Netlify.
